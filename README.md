Iâ€™ve designed an interactive website header that dynamically displays live cryptocurrency prices. Leveraging HTML and CSS, I crafted a responsive and visually appealing interface. With JavaScript, I integrated a free API to fetch real-time price data, ensuring the information is current and accurate. This feature enhances user engagement by providing valuable market insights directly on the homepage.
